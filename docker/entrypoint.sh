# NO OCR LANGUAGE-DATA SEEDING HERE ANY MORE, and nothing needs to replace it.
# tesseract.js downloaded ~15 MB of `.traineddata` on first use and cached it under
# $DATA_DIR/tessdata — which is a VOLUME, so the image's build-time copy was hidden
# behind the mount and had to be re-seeded from /app/seed on every fresh volume.
# The native engine reads its language data from /usr/share/tesseract-ocr, i.e. from
# the image itself, where a volume cannot hide it.

# --- schema ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Migrations are applied on every boot. They are the only writer of the schema, so
# a fresh volume gets a working DB with no manual step, and an upgraded image
# applies its new migrations before it starts answering requests.
#
# A FAILED MIGRATION MUST STOP THE CONTAINER. Starting the API against a
# half-migrated database would answer requests with confusing 500s instead, and the
# healthcheck would report the container as fine.
