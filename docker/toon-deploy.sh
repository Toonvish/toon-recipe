#
# Server-side deploy command for toon-recipe.
#
# THIS IS A FORCED COMMAND, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. It is installed on the
# server as /usr/local/bin/toon-deploy and pinned to the GitHub Actions key in
# ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:
#
#   restrict,command="/usr/local/bin/toon-deploy" ssh-ed25519 AAAA… github-actions-deploy
#
# sshd then ignores whatever the client asked to run and executes this instead,
# putting the client's request in $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND. So the private key that
# lives in GitHub's secret store does not buy a shell on the box: it buys exactly
# the three verbs below, on exactly one image repository, and `restrict` also
# takes away port forwarding, agent forwarding, X11 and a pty.
#
# Two consequences worth knowing:
#
#   * THE IMAGE REPOSITORY IS PINNED HERE, not sent by the client. The caller may
#     choose a digest or `latest`; it may not choose a registry. Otherwise a stolen
#     key could point the server at any image on the internet, which is a root
#     shell in a trench coat.
#   * The workflow can no longer scp docker-compose.yml over, the way the
#     pre-2026-08 deploy job did. `sync-config` below fetches it from the
#     repository instead, and it is deliberately a SEPARATE verb: a compose change
#     is a configuration change and deserves a human, not a silent side effect of
#     every push to main.
#   * IT NO LONGER FETCHES A CADDYFILE. TLS terminates in the shared `toon-edge`
#     stack (/opt/toon-edge) now, so this app has no proxy config of its own. The
#     edge Caddyfile is maintained by hand — it changes only when an app is added,
#     and a bad one takes EVERY app on the host offline, so it does not belong
#     behind an automated fetch.
#
# Run it by hand exactly as CI does — the arguments work either way:
#
#   toon-deploy deploy latest
#   toon-deploy deploy sha256:<64 hex>
#   toon-deploy sync-config
#
set -euo pipefail

# Both overridable from the environment for a non-standard install, but note that
# `restrict` means the SSH client cannot set them — they are the server's call.
