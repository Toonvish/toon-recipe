/**
 * The unsaved-work registry, which is what stands between a service-worker update and
 * a half-typed recipe. Its failure mode is silent — a claim that leaks keeps the app on
 * an old version forever, and one that releases too early discards the user's edits — so
 * the counting is pinned here.
 *
 * The imperative core only; `useUnsavedWork` is a two-line `useEffect` around it.
 * `bun:test` types come from the ambient shim at src/features/import/lib/bun-test.d.ts.
