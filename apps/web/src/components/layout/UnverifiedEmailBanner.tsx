/**
 * Always-visible explanation while this account is held read-only for an
 * unconfirmed e-mail address (lib/session.tsx's `useEmailVerificationBlock`).
 *
 * WHY A BANNER AND NOT JUST DISABLED BUTTONS. Every write in the app already
 * disables itself with a `title`, but a disabled button on a touch screen has no
 * hover and therefore no tooltip — on a phone the entire app would simply be
 * inert with no explanation anywhere. So the reason is stated once, at the top of
 * every screen, next to the only thing that fixes it.
 *
 * TALLER THAN `OfflineBanner` on purpose: that one describes a state the user can
 * neither cause nor fix and which usually ends by itself, this one is an
 * instruction. It links to /settings rather than resending inline, because the
 * resend button, its rate limit and its three-state delivery report already live
 * on `EmailVerificationCard` and a second copy would drift.
