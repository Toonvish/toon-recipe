 * The phone-only row above a screen's `<h1>`: the active-group chip on the left, one
 * screen-specific action on the right (artboards 1e, 1g). Hidden from `lg`, where the
 * sidebar carries the group switcher.
 *
 * It scrolls with the page ON PURPOSE — no `sticky`, no `pt-safe`. `AppShell`'s inner
 * column owns the status-bar inset now that `TopBar` is gone, and a second `pt-safe`
 * here would double it.
 *
 * A `<header>`, not a `<div>`, and that is load-bearing: `print.css` hides
 * `header[data-app-shell]` — the selector `TopBar` was written for and never matched,
 * because no element ever carried the attribute. This row is that future header, so
 * the tag and the attribute together are what keep the chrome off a printed recipe.
