/**
 * TanStack Query hooks for saved cards.
 *
 * READ OFFLINE, WRITE ONLINE — and the asymmetry is the design, not a gap:
 *
 *  - the LIST is persisted (`shouldPersistQuery` in lib/persist.ts) and its query
 *    is `offlineFirst`, because a card is shown at a till where the phone may have
 *    no signal at all,
 *  - the MUTATIONS are ordinary online mutations with no offline queue. Saving a
 *    card is a deliberate, one-off action performed at home, so there is nothing to
 *    gain from an outbox — and a lot to lose: `setMutationDefaults` plus a
 *    client-minted idempotency token exist for the shopping list because items
 *    MERGE, and none of that machinery would be paying for itself here.
 *
 * That is why these screens use `useCanMutate()` (false offline) — the exact
 * opposite of the shopping screens, which must not.

 * card was deleted on another device. The barcode is already on screen; a toast
