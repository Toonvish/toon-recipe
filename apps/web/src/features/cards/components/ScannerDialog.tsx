/**
 * Camera scanner: point it at the card, get `{ format, value }` back.
 *
 * The whole dialog is written around one fact — **scanning is the optional half of
 * this feature**. It needs a camera, a permission, and (once) a connection for the
 * ~1.1 MB decoder, and any of the three can be missing. So every failure path ends
 * in the same place: "type the number instead", as a real button that closes this
 * dialog and puts the cursor in the form's field. Nothing here is ever a dead end.
 *
 * Lifecycle: the camera is opened when the dialog opens and stopped in the effect's
 * cleanup. Leaving a stream running after close keeps the recording indicator lit,
 * which reads as a bug and is a genuine privacy problem — so `stop()` is called on
 * unmount, on success, and on failure.
