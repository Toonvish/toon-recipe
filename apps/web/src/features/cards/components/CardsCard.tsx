/**
 * The "Treuekarten" panel on `/shopping` — the ONLY way into the wallet on a phone.
 *
 * `/shopping/cards` is not a tab (the tab bar is full and deliberately so, see
 * `components/layout/nav-items.ts`) and there is no sidebar below `lg`, so deleting
 * this panel would make the whole feature unreachable on the device it exists for.
 * Same rule as `GroupsCard` on `/settings`.
 *
 * It shows the saved cards as chips that open the till screen DIRECTLY, because
 * that is the actual journey: you are standing at the checkout with the shopping
 * list open and you need the Payback code now, not after two more taps. Managing
 * them is the secondary action.
 *
 * `compact` is `1g`'s condensed phone tile in the overview's 2-up grid (a heading
 * plus the single most relevant card); the default is `1c`'s wider desktop panel
 * (the chip row, the "Manage" link and a dashed "+ Karte hinzufügen" tile). Both are
 * ONE component with ONE data source (`useCards`) — the compact tile still routes
 * to `/shopping/cards`, so it never becomes a second, forked way into the wallet.
 *
 * The dashed add tile is gated with `useCanMutate()` — the OPPOSITE rule from this
 * screen's list/plan actions (`ShoppingListsPage`'s own `canManage`): a card write
 * is an ordinary online mutation with no offline outbox, so `canMutate: false`
 * offline is exactly right here, unlike on the shopping screens themselves.
 * Showing a barcode is a read and is never gated at all.
