/**
 * Minimal ambient declaration for `bun:test`.
 *
 * The web tsconfig sets `types: ["vite/client"]`, so the Bun test globals are not
 * part of this program — without this shim every `apps/web/src/**` test file would
 * fail `tsc` with TS2307 even though `bun test` runs them fine. It declares the
 * module globally, so it covers `lib/i18n/i18n.test.ts` too, not just its
 * neighbours. Delete this file if `@types/bun` is ever added to
 * apps/web/tsconfig.json.
 *
 * It is a SUBSET of the real API, so a matcher that works under `bun test` can
 * still fail `tsc` here — add it below rather than rewriting the assertion.
