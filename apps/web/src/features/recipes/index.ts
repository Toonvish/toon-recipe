/**
 * Recipe feature barrel.
 *
 * THE ROUTE SCREENS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT RE-EXPORTED HERE. `router.tsx` reaches them
 * with `lazyRouteComponent(() => import("@/features/recipes/RecipeListPage"))`; a
 * static re-export from a barrel anything else imports would pull the same module
 * into the main chunk, and rollup would report the dynamic import as ineffective —
 * i.e. the code splitting would silently stop working. Import a screen by its own
 * path if you ever need it directly.
