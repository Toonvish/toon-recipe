/**
 * Phone filter sheet — the same `RecipeFilterFields` as `RecipeFilterRail`, mounted
 * inside a `Dialog` (bottom sheet below `sm`, centred modal from `sm`). `RecipeListPage`
 * opens it from the "Filter" text button next to the search field (`lg:hidden`, since the
 * rail is permanent from `lg` up).
 *
 * A fresh `Dialog` mount is a fresh component tree each time it opens, so `autoFocus`
 * inside `RecipeFilterFields`'s controls (none today, but see `Select`/`Input`) would be
 * safe here even though it is NOT safe against an already-mounted screen — the gotcha
 * that bit the barcode scanner's "Nummer eintippen" field does not apply to a sheet.
