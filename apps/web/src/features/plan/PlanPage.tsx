/**
 * PlanPage — `/plan`, the meal planner. EXTRAPOLATED (no artboard): A05 draws only
 * the library's four-day week strip, so every token here is that strip's own
 * `planned`/`empty`/`today` palette (A05 §10.7), reused for a full seven-day week.
 *
 * The week is REAL URL STATE (`?week=`), normalised to its Monday by
 * `router.tsx`'s `validateSearch` before this component ever sees it — the second
 * `startOfPlanWeek()`/`todayPlanDate()` fallback below is defence in depth for a
 * hand-edited or half-migrated URL, not the primary guard.
 *
 * Entries arrive as a FLAT, `(plannedOn, position)`-sorted list (never grouped by
 * day server-side, see `MealPlanRangeResponseSchema`), so grouping into the
 * week's seven slots is this component's job, not the API's. `/plan` hands each
 * `PlanDayCard` its day's WHOLE entry list (no `maxEntries` cap) — PLAN.md §4
 * R36 reserves the first-plus-`+N` fold for the library's week strip only.
