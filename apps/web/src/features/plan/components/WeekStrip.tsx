/**
 * WeekStrip — the library's "Diese Woche" strip (A04 §3.2/§4, reconstructed, no
 * artboard — SPEC.md §1/D10). Always shows the week CONTAINING today
 * (`startOfPlanWeek`, i.e. its Monday), never a week the URL chose: unlike `/plan`
 * itself this is a preview, not a navigation surface, so it holds no `?week=` state
 * and its only navigation is the `plan.strip.link` beside the heading.
 *
 * Reuses `PlanDayCard` (T7.4) for all three drawn states (`planned`/`empty`/
 * `today`) rather than reimplementing them — the card, its `ActionMenu`s and its
 * dialogs are unchanged here; this component only decides WHICH days to show and
 * hands each one its slice of the week's entries, exactly like `PlanPage` does.
 *
 * Desktop renders all 7 days as an equal `grid-cols-7`. **A phone SCROLLS all 7
 * horizontally, starting on today**, which is A04 §4's own "try next" note rather
 * than the artboard's four-up crop — and it is a correction of two measured faults
 * in that crop, not a preference. (1) The crop was a literal `week.slice(3, 7)`,
 * i.e. Thu..Sun whatever day it was, so from Monday to Wednesday the phone strip
 * left TODAY out altogether — the one day a week preview exists to show. (2) Four
 * cards across 390px is 80px each, 58px of it text, and a German recipe title
 * broke mid-word inside it ("Schnelle r Schokok uchen"); a recipe title carries no
 * clamp and no truncation anywhere in this app, so the only honest fix is to give
 * it a card it fits in. `w-daycard` is that card, `scrollLeft` starts the
 * scroller on today, and the week is still one fetch and one component.
 *
 * `maxEntries={1}` caps a busy day to its first entry plus a `+N` link to `/plan`
 * (R36) — this strip has no room for a second entry the way `/plan`'s own column
 * does — and `compact` drops the per-entry `ActionMenu` and thumbnail for the same
 * reason of width (see `PlanDayCard`).

    Today is the day this strip is about, and a horizontal scroller opens at
    `scrollLeft: 0` — Monday. So the position is set once, imperatively, rather
    than by reordering the days: Mon..Sun in the DOM is what a week IS, and it is
    also the reading and tab order. `scrollLeft` (not `scrollIntoView`, which
    would also scroll the PAGE to the strip on every load) and no `behavior:
    "smooth"`, so it is the initial position rather than a visible animation.
    A LAYOUT effect, because `useEffect` runs after paint and the strip flashed
    at Monday before jumping to today. The offset is measured from today's own
    `<li>` rather than computed from a card width, so the CSS is the only place
    the width lives. Runs when the data lands too — the pending branch renders a
    skeleton instead of this element, so the ref is null on the first pass.
