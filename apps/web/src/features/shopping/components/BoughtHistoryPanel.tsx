/**
 * BoughtHistoryPanel — the "Bought history" rail panel on `/shopping` (artboards
 * 1c/1g), column 3. Reads the SAME cross-list feed `/shopping/history` (T8.8) pages
 * through in full; this panel only ever shows its first three day buckets and links
 * `Alle`/`All` to that screen for the rest.
 *
 * Unlike `WeekPlanPanel`, this segment IS on the persist allow-list
 * (`"shopping-bought"`, R24) — its rows are readable with no connection, so it is
 * worth reading offline, and the asymmetry with the plan panel is deliberate (see
 * that file's own doc comment).
 *
 * Renders NOTHING AT ALL — heading included — while pending or with no history
 * (R44, the same rule as `BoughtSection` on the list detail): a day-grouped rail
 * panel with nothing to show is not a screen the user navigated to, so there is no
 * `shopping.history.empty` here; that key belongs to the `/shopping/history` page,
 * which the user *did* choose to open.
