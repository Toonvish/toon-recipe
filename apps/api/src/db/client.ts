 * WITHOUT THESE, EVERY WRITE COSTS A FULL fsync. libSQL's defaults are
 * `journal_mode=delete` + `synchronous=FULL`, which measured (ext4, NVMe) at
 * **15.5 ms for a single-row INSERT**; WAL alone brings that to 5.2 ms and
 * WAL + `synchronous=NORMAL` to **0.04 ms**. On the slow storage a cheap VPS or an
 * SD-card machine offers, the untuned figure is far worse. It is paid by every shopping-list
 * write (i.e. every replayed offline mutation) and by the `sessions.last_used_at`
 * refresh that any request older than a minute triggers.
 *
 * `journal_mode` is PERSISTENT in the database file, but `synchronous` is
 * PER-CONNECTION — which is exactly why this belongs here and not in a migration.
 * A connection that skips it silently falls back to FULL and pays 5 ms a write.
 *
 * `synchronous=NORMAL` under WAL is the documented durability trade: a commit is
 * still crash-safe, but the last transactions can be lost if the OS itself dies
 * (power cut, kernel panic). For a family recipe box that is the right trade;
 * nothing here is a ledger.
 *
 * NEVER SENT TO A REMOTE DATABASE. Against `libsql://…turso.io` these are
 * meaningless at best — the storage engine is not ours — so they are skipped, as
 * they are for `:memory:` (no journal, nothing to tune).
