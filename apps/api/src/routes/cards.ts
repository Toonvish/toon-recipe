/**
 * Saved cards ("Karten") — the user's own loyalty barcodes.
 *
 * Mounted at /api/cards (see src/index.ts). THE ONLY ROUTER THAT IS NOT
 * GROUP-SCOPED: a card belongs to the signed-in user, so there is no `:groupId`
 * segment and no `requireGroupRole()` — `requireSession()` plus the `userId`
 * every service call carries IS the authorisation. See the header of
 * packages/shared/src/schemas/card.ts for why this entity is not group-owned.
 *
 * Endpoint contract: docs/API.md ("Saved cards").
 *
 *   GET    /                -> the wallet, most recently used first
 *   POST   /                -> save a card
 *   PATCH  /:cardId         -> rename / re-note / change the code
 *   DELETE /:cardId         -> forget it
 *   POST   /:cardId/used    -> record that it was shown (the wallet's ordering)
 *
 * WRITES NEED A CONFIRMED ADDRESS, like every other write in the app
 * (middleware/verifiedEmail.ts, and a no-op on a deployment that cannot mail).
 * `use("*")` is safe here because there is no escape-hatch write in this router
 * the way `POST /invites/accept` is one in routes/groups.ts. It does mean
 * `POST /:cardId/used` answers 403 for an unconfirmed account — which is why the
 * web client fires that one and forgets it (see features/cards/lib/queries.ts):
 * losing the "most recently used" bump must never break showing the card.
