/**
 * Database accessor for the import routes.
 *
 * Production behaviour is exactly "use the shared drizzle instance". The
 * indirection exists so integration tests can point the import routes at their
 * own database, which is REQUIRED here and not just convenient:
 *
 *   @libsql/client 0.17.4 loses an in-memory database as soon as a transaction
 *   is committed — `client.transaction()` + `commit()` leaves the client talking
 *   to a fresh, empty `file::memory:` DB ("no such table: users"). Since
 *   `commitDraft` is transactional by design, its tests must run against a
 *   file-backed (or `?cache=shared`) database. See the agent report.
 *
 * The setter is inert outside NODE_ENV=test.
