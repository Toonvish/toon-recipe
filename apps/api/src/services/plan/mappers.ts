/**
 * Wire mappers for the meal planner: the slim recipe a plan card renders and the

 *
 * `note` is not mapped: `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`'s `meal_plan_entries` table
 * carries no `note` column (A02 §2.1 sketched one; T3.1 dropped it — no artboard
 * draws it and dead schema is how a second, differently-shaped column gets added
 * later). `packages/shared/src/schemas/plan.ts` still types the field as
 * `nullish()` for a future migration, so `null` here parses cleanly; it just has
 * nowhere to come from yet.
