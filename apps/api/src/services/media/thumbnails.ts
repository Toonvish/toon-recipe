/**
 * List thumbnails for stored uploads.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. `recipes.image_url` points at the original upload — a phone photo or
 * a hero image the URL importer downloaded, routinely 2–5 MB. The recipe list asks
 * for up to 24 of them at once, so a single screen used to pull tens of megabytes
 * through a home uplink to paint images no larger than a thumb.
 *
 * THE SCHEME. A derivative lives NEXT TO the original under a name built from it:
 * `<uuid>.jpg` -> `<uuid>.jpg.thumb.webp`, {@link THUMBNAIL_WIDTH} px wide WebP.
 * Because that is still one flat filename under UPLOAD_DIR, everything around it
 * keeps working untouched: `signUploadUrl()` signs it like any other upload, the
 * `/uploads/:filename` route serves it, and the traversal checks are the same ones.
 *
 * IT IS BUILT ON DEMAND, not at upload time — that is deliberate. The URL is minted
 * from the row (see `toRecipe`), which knows nothing about what exists on disk, so
 * every recipe stored before this feature, and every one whose image arrived through
 * a path that forgot to warm it, has to work anyway. {@link resolveThumbnail} builds
 * a missing derivative on first request and caches it on disk; {@link warmThumbnail}
 * is only a head start for the common case.
 *
 * A FAILED CONVERSION SERVES THE ORIGINAL. sharp may be missing entirely, or built
 * without the HEIF plugin — an iPhone HEIC is the realistic case. Answering 404 there
 * would turn a working recipe into a broken `<img>`, so the route falls back to the
 * full-size file and says so via a short max-age, which lets the answer heal itself
 * once the derivative can be built.
