/**
 * OWNER: auth agent.
 *
 * Whether an account with an UNCONFIRMED e-mail address may write.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Registration is open, so anybody can mint an account and start
 * filling a group with recipes, imports and shopping lines. Requiring a confirmed
 * address before the first write costs a real spammer a working mailbox per
 * account and costs an honest user one click, so an unconfirmed account is
 * READ-ONLY: every GET works, accepting an invite works, and every write answers
 * 403 `email_unverified`.
 *
 * IT FOLLOWS THE MAILER, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY STORY. `MAIL_TRANSPORT` is
 * unset by default — in `docker-compose.yml` too — so a fresh self-hosted stack
 * runs the ConsoleMailer and a confirmation link only ever reaches the server log.
 * Gating writes on clicking a link that was never mailed would turn `docker
 * compose up` into a permanently read-only app whose only way out is grepping the
 * log, so {@link isVerifiedEmailRequired} keys off {@link isMailConfigured} — the
 * same transport-name rule `mailDeliveryOf()` uses. No mail, no gate; configure
 * SMTP or Resend and it switches itself on. There is deliberately NO env variable
 * for this: the one people would set is the one that bricks the install.
 *
 * IT IS AN AUTHORISATION CHECK, NOT A CAPABILITY. Unlike
 * `services/import/capabilities.ts` the client is told the answer up front
 * (`features.verifiedEmailRequired` on `/api/health`) only so the UI can explain
 * itself; `requireVerifiedEmail()` in src/middleware/verifiedEmail.ts is what
 * actually enforces it.
 *
 * THE TIMESTAMP IS THE EVIDENCE, never the boolean — same rule as everywhere else
 * in this codebase, and for the same reason (see the header of
 * services/auth/emailVerification.ts): `email_verified` was once true for every
 * self-registration, so a gate reading it would have been open to exactly the
 * accounts it is meant to stop.
 *
 * THE SEAM ({@link setVerifiedEmailRequired}) exists because a test that wants the
 * gate ON would otherwise have to install a fake SMTP transport. Same discipline
 * as `setMailer` / `setOcrImportEnabled`: `bun test` runs every file in ONE
 * process, so a file that overrides this MUST hand it back
 * (`afterAll(() => setVerifiedEmailRequired(null))`) or the next file inherits it.
