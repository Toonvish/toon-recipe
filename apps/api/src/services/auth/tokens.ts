 * Minting and hashing for the single-use secrets that travel in a mailed link
 * (password reset, e-mail confirmation).
 *
 * TWO RULES, both deliberate:
 *
 *  1. The token is 32 bytes of CSPRNG output, base64url — the same entropy as a
 *     session id, because a reset token is briefly worth exactly as much.
 *  2. Only its SHA-256 hash is stored. `group_invites` keeps the raw token and
 *     that is fine (a leaked invite costs group membership); a leaked reset table
 *     would cost every account, so this one is one-way. No salt and no argon2:
 *     the input is already 256 random bits, so there is nothing to grind, and a
 *     salted hash could not be looked up by token at all.
