/**
 * At-most-once execution for shopping mutations — the piece that makes offline
 * editing safe rather than merely possible.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * A phone in airplane mode queues "Lasagne auf die Liste" and replays it on
 * reconnect (apps/web/src/features/shopping/lib/offline.ts). If the ORIGINAL request
 * reached the server and only its response was lost, the replay applies it again.
 * Because shopping items merge by quantity, the result is not a visible duplicate row
 * you would notice — it is "500 g Mehl" quietly becoming "1 kg Mehl". You find out at
 * the till.
 *
 * So every replayable mutation carries a client-generated `mutationId` (a uuid) and
 * the API records it in `shopping_mutations` as part of the same write. A second
 * request with that id applies nothing and returns the CURRENT state, which is what
 * the client would have got the first time.
 *
 * ## Why the check is not a SELECT
 *
 * `hasApplied()` + "then write" is a race: two replays of the same id can both read
 * "not applied". The claim is therefore an INSERT on a primary key —
 * {@link claimMutation} returns false when the insert conflicts, and only the request
 * that won the insert proceeds. On a memory DB (tests) `withTransaction` degrades to
 * sequential statements, so a failure AFTER a successful claim leaves the id claimed
 * and the mutation unapplied. That is the deliberate trade: a lost mutation the user
 * can repeat by hand beats a silently doubled amount.
