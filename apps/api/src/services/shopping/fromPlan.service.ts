/**
 * "From this week's plan" (SPEC § 4.5 / A03 § 5): diffs a shopping list against the
 * group's meal plan and reports, per planned recipe, which ingredients are not on
 * the list yet.
 *
 * R21 put this in the shopping router under the name `from-plan`, not a
 * `plan-suggestions` endpoint on the planner: the diff is against a LIST, so it
 * belongs to the list's router — and pathing it under `…/shopping-lists/` is what
 * lets the existing `NetworkOnly` service-worker rule cover it with no new rule.
 *
 * R23 refuses a `GET …/summary` endpoint by the same logic this file has to
 * respect for itself: a local libSQL file is ONE serialised lane, so the lever is
 * a MEASURED, BOUNDED query, never more concurrency. `PLAN_LIMITS.fromPlanEntries`
 * (60, earliest `plannedOn` first) is that bound — see the PR for the measured
 * median against a scratch file DB.

/**
 * `planShoppingPreview(db, groupId, listId, { from, to })`.
 *
 * 1. Loads the target list's OPEN item rows and builds `onList` from their stored
 *    `merge_key`s — NOT the name, so "200 g Mehl" counts as missing while "2 EL
 *    Mehl" is on the list: they are different unit buckets and cannot merge, so
 *    both are genuinely needed.
 * 2. Loads the window's plan entries (already `(plannedOn, position)` ordered by
 *    `listPlanEntries`), caps them at `PLAN_LIMITS.fromPlanEntries` (earliest
 *    first — the bound this file exists to honour), then de-duplicates by recipe,
 *    KEEPING THE EARLIEST `plannedOn` and that entry's `servings` — a recipe
 *    planned twice in one week is one row in the panel.
 * 3. Per recipe: scales its CURRENT ingredients exactly as `addRecipeToShoppingList`
 *    does (`servings / servingsAmount` when both are positive, else factor 1 —
 *    the SAME fallback rule, so the preview and the eventual add agree), then
 *    checks EVERY ingredient row's key individually against `onList` — never
 *    merged first, because `missingIngredientIds` must list every row sharing a
 *    missing key, and `recipeToShoppingItems` would collapse them before their
 *    ids could be recovered.
 * 4. A recipe with nothing missing is omitted from `recipes` entirely.
