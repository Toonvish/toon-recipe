# =============================================================================
# toon-recipe — one image, one origin, one port.
#
# The API serves the built PWA from its own port (see
# apps/api/src/middleware/staticWeb.ts), so a deployment needs no second web
# server, no CORS entry and no API URL baked into the bundle. That is the whole
# reason this is a single container and not three.
#
# BUILT FOR A SMALL 64-BIT LINUX SERVER, WHICH SHAPES THREE DECISIONS:
#
#  1. TARGETS ARE linux/amd64 AND linux/arm64, 64-bit only. There is no Bun build
#     for 32-bit anything, so `uname -m` on the host has to say `x86_64` or
#     `aarch64`; a 32-bit userland cannot run this image at all.
#  2. DEBIAN, NOT ALPINE. `sharp` ships prebuilt glibc binaries for both targets;
#     on musl it would be rebuilt from source on the target, which takes the
#     better part of an hour when it works. Debian also has `tesseract-ocr` and
#     `poppler-utils` as ordinary packages, which is what the OCR and PDF
#     pipelines shell out to — installed only for `--build-arg WITH_OCR=1` /
#     `WITH_PDF=1`.
#
# PHOTO AND PDF IMPORT ARE OPT-IN, AND SEPARATELY SO. The default build omits
# tesseract and poppler entirely, so the image stays small enough for a low-spec
# VPS and both are switched off end to end (501 + hidden in the UI). `--build-arg
# WITH_OCR=1` adds German photo import; `WITH_PDF=1` (which WITH_OCR implies unless
# you say otherwise) adds PDFs on top. See docs/deployment.md.
#  3. THE WEB BUNDLE IS BUILT ON THE BUILD PLATFORM ($BUILDPLATFORM), not the
#     target. Its output is architecture-independent JavaScript, so building it
#     natively on the amd64 CI runner instead of under QEMU emulation is the
#     difference between a ~4 minute and a ~40 minute cross-build. Only the native
#     node_modules are installed for the target architecture.

# --- optional: native OCR + PDF rasterization -------------------------------
# PHOTO AND PDF IMPORT ARE OPT-IN AT BUILD TIME, AND THEY ARE TWO SEPARATE ARGS.
# The default build leaves both out, which is what lets the image run on a small
# VPS. URL and text import need none of this.
#
#   WITH_OCR=1   tesseract-ocr + tesseract-ocr-deu  (~105 MB) — PHOTO import.
#                Debian's tesseract-ocr HARD-DEPENDS on tesseract-ocr-eng and
#                pulls -osd, so English data is present whether or not it is
#                asked for; TESSERACT_LANGS is therefore a runtime lever (speed
#                and memory), not a build-time one. Any OTHER language still
#                needs its own tesseract-ocr-<lang> package added here — a
#                missing one fails at recognise time, not at boot.
#   WITH_PDF=1   poppler-utils, i.e. pdftoppm (~28 MB) — the PDF rasterizer,
#                services/ocr/pdf.ts.
#
# WHY THEY SPLIT. A photo is one tesseract run; a scanned PDF is up to
# MAX_PDF_PAGES of them, and on a one-core VPS that cannot finish inside
# OCR_TIMEOUT_MS however much RAM the box has. So `--build-arg WITH_OCR=1
# --build-arg WITH_PDF=0` is a real, supported image: German photo import on a
# 1 GB box, PDFs honestly switched off rather than offered and timing out.
#
# WITH_PDF DEFAULTS TO WITH_OCR, so the pre-split invocation (`--build-arg
# WITH_OCR=1` alone) still produces exactly the image it always did.
#
# The runtime flags DEFAULT TO THE BUILD ARGS, so the image is self-consistent: it
# advertises `features.{ocrImport,pdfImport}` to match what is installed, its
# upload endpoints answer 501 for what is missing, and the web UI stops offering
# it. Overriding a flag on an image without the binary is not a crash — the
# pipeline answers the documented 422 naming it — but there is no reason to do it.
#
# tini reaps zombies and forwards signals. Keep it even without OCR: it is PID 1 for
# the whole container, and with OCR every recognition is a CHILD PROCESS that would
# otherwise be left a zombie on an aborted or timed-out import.
